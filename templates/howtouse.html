    <h1> Encryption </h1>
    <p> On the <a href="/encrypt">encrypt</a> tab in the navigation bar you can encrypt any text in unicode that does not exceed a certain character limit (depending on the image) to send to someone. </p>
    <p> The character limit depends on the attached image, and right after the attachment, the limit is shown above the text box of the message. The calculation is made in relation to how many pixels the image has, considering the steganography method used and explained in the <a href="/about">about</a> tab. </p>
